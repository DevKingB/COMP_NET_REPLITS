'''
Consider an Internet path over which data can be transmitted at a rate of 5 megabits/sec in both directions. The path include 3 links and 2 routers. 
Each link is 3000 kilometers long. Signal propagates over the links at a speed of 2 Ã— 108 meters per second. 
A HTTP client at one end of the path downloads a web page and the web objects referenced within the page from a HTTP server at the other end of the path. 
Suppose the web page size is 29 kilobytes, 18 images are embedded in the web page and each of them is 190 kilobytes. 
Consider transmission delay and propagation delay only. The web page and images are stored on the same web server. 
Assume TCP connection requests/responses and HTTP requests are small enough for their transmission delay to be ignored. 
The maximum packet size is 1 kilobytes. Ignore header size.

How long is the RTT?
For non-persistant HTTP,
    - How much time elapses from the beginning to when the first packet arrives at the router connected to the HTTP server?
    - How much time elapses from the beginning to when the first packet arrives at the router two hops away from the server?
    - How much time elapses from the beginning to when the HTTP client receives the first packet?
    - How much time elapses from the beginning to when the HTTP client receives the whole web page?
For non-persistant HTTP using a single TCP connection at any time, how much time elapses from the beginning to when the HTTP client receives the first image?
For non-persistant HTTP using a single TCP connection at any time, how much time elapses from the beginning to when the web page can be displayed (i.e. when the HTTP client receives the web page and all the images)?
For non-persistant HTTP using multiple TCP connections simultaneously, how much time elapses from the beginning to when the web page can be displayed?
For persistant HTTP, how much time elapses from the beginning to when the web page can be displayed?
The answers must be in seconds and rounded to the nearest thousandth. Separate them with commas.
